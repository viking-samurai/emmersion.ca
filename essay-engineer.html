											<p>Essays and formal-style writing is very challenging, especially for people without 
												a great sense of linguistics in either English or French.  It's very hard to research 
												facts, and then to present those facts in a way that is both accurate, intelligent, 
												and interesting.  At E-mmersion.ca, we specialize in helping students and researchers 
												develop skills that will improve this part of their educational or academic careers, 
												and in doing so, we help people find joy in their research as well.  Who knows, you 
												might be a professor waiting to be discovered, if only you were interested in writing 
												about the things you research.</p>
		
											<h3>Why learn essay writing with E-mmersion?</h3>
											<p>Essay writing is an essential career aspect for anyone who wants to become a researcher, 
												or advance into higher academia.  If you can't write well about the things that you research, 
												then you will likely get overlooked by many scholarly magazines and universities, which 
												will impact your career prospects quite negatively.  But fear not!  Formal-style writing is 
												not as challenging as it looks.  It just takes time to practice, and a little encouragement 
												to find your inner voice.  While tools like Grammarly or ProWritingAid can help with this, 
												wouldn't it be nice to have these skills at your disposal, and stop using robots to do all 
												the work?</p>

											<p>Lastly, formal writing skills help with formal speaking skills.  And if you can write it, you 
												can sell it.  AI assisted writing doesn't actually help with this, as it removes the learning 
												from the task altogether, denying you the confidence that you would have developed if you actually 
												had written it.  By taking the time to learn formal writing skills, you not only gain a valuable 
												skillset while most AI tools are still in development, but you also improve your speech patterns 
												and confidence along with it.  This is especially true for newcomers to Canada, who get almost 
												no intellectual benefit from using AI tools altogether.  If you're ready to take on a new challenge, 
												such as a university degree, and you want some writing skills to help along the way, then use the

												opportunity today!</p>
