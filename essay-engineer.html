											<p>Coding and programming are one of the most sought after skillsets in today's job 
												market, and for good reason.  They are a highly technical skillset that requires 
												practitioners to think both mathematically and linguistically, generally at the 
												same time.  As AI and automation continue to move into the workforce, those who 
												have the ability to work with modern technology are able to make businesses 
												more efficient, and then become invaluable to that business in the process.
												Learning coding and programming earlier in life helps ensure that you or your 
												children won't get left behind.</p>
		
											<h3>Why learn through web development?</h3>
											<p>The Internet offers a unique way for students to learn coding and programming 
												through modern web development. The trade promotes cognitive growth, is free 
												to set-up and start learning, and provides learners with a unique medium for 
												art and self-expression.  With E-mmersion.ca, Beginner coding starts students 
												off with the basics: HTML5 and CSS3.  Students learn to control form before 
												function, and move slowly through the different technologies that go into web 
												development.  This helps learners get a feel for how the various langauges 
												are all connected, and how they work together to create a whole.
											<p>Withe E-mmersion.ca's advanced coding classes, students pick up where our beginner
												courses leave off, continuing with HTML5 and CSS3, but adding JavaScript programming 
												to the mix as well.  JavaScript is currently both the most common and the most sought 
												after programming language in modern software development, and, given that it is 
												considered ‘the language of the Internet’, it is likely to remain a dominant programming 
												language for years to come.  The courses below are designed to be taken as collaborative 
												learning opportunities in either English or French, but can also be prepared for one 
												on one tutoring as well.  Use the <a href="#footer">contact form</a> below to get 
												started on your next learning opportunity today!</p>
