										<p>Collaborative learning and digital literacy are hot topics in many educational 
											spheres, and for good reason.  Children who learn and develop an understanding 
											of these skills and technologies earlier in their lives tend to learn them more 
											effectively, and are able to use them more consistently in the world around them.  
											This leads to many more, as well as much better opportunities for students, 
											particularly as they transition into young adults, and begin to enter the 
											workforce.</p>

										<h3>What are the benefits?</h3>
										<p>The benefits of learning coding and programming early are twofold.  First off,
											students who are digitally literate have much higher employment prospects then
											those who aren't.  This is because, as the world becomes more reliant on digital
											technologies, those who are digitally literate are more efficient at navigating
											the requirements of the modern work environment then those who aren't, and their
											employment mobility will reflect this.</p>

										<p>Second, as with learning a second language, there are numerous cognitive benefits
											that come from mastering the rigours of learning coding and programming.  It 
											opens up new ways of thinking, and teaches students to process visual space in 
											different dimensions than what they may normally be taught.  It also stengthens 
											processes in key areas of the brain that are responsible for critical thinking, 
											spacial organization, and memory retention.</p>
