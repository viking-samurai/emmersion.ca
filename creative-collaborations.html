											<p>Let's face it, to many people, writing is hard.  And writing serious fiction?
												Very hard.  Between plot, character development, and creating settings that 
												actually make sense, the task can be daunting.  Add to that that it's often 
												a required programme for most highschool diplomas, and the task can seem downright 
												overwhelming.  But fear no more, as E-mmersion.ca has a course designed specifically 
												to help stuggling writers feel confident in abilities, and make it through their 
												normal public education.  While not everyone is destined to become a professional 
												creative writer, at E-mmersion.ca, we can help you get through grade school, and 
												restore some lost confidence along the way.</p>
		
											<h3>Why learn creative writing with E-mmersion?</h3>
											<p>Creative writing is an especially liberating art-form, as it allows a writer
												to bounce between the real and the fantastic without having to switch up their 
												style or bounce between different works.  There is an inherent assumption that 
												creative writing is what it is, and that formal writing is what it is, but this 
												is actually no more than that.  An assumption.  In reality, writing for an audience 
												through a medium that is supposed to the relaxing to interpret actually forces 
												the writer to concentrate on reality more than most people assume.  By doing so, 
												all the parts of the art-form actually come together much more readily, and create 
												a more seemless and enjoyable experience for the audience.</p>

											<p>Furthermore, creative writing is an excellent way to become a great writer in general.
												It's emphasis on story over facts allows writers a greater degree of flexibility 
												in how they develop a story, which can be a lot less stressful than more formal syles 
												of writing, such as an essay.  For this reason, it can be an excellent tool for 
												newcomers to Canada to imporve on the official languages of this nation.  By not focusing 
												so heavily on facts and proof, writers are more free to express themselves linguistically,
												and improve their sense of how either English or French looks and feelsinstead, as opposed 
												to research-based writing, which gets boring and can become tiresome, causing people to 
												learn the languages less efficiently.  Use the <a href="#footer">contact form</a> below
